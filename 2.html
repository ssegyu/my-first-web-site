  <h2>CSS</h2>
  <p>Like HTML, CSS is not really a programming language. It's not even a markup language.
    It's the Style sheet language. It means that you can selectively apply style to elements
    in HTML documents.For example, if you want to select all paragraph elements on an HTML
    page and change the text inside them to red, you would write a CSS as follows.
